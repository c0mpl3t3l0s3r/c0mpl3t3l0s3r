This page contains information regarding Kernel Panic errors in A1286 Macbook Pro laptops from 2008-12.<br>
<br>
Motherboard Revision: EMC No.:2353 i5<br>
<br>
**The pcb isn't really marked so it is unclear exactly what capacitor it is. <br>
  If I can find a schematic I will update this.**<br>
<br>
If the computer switch's between the igpu to the onboard graphics chip the computer will freeze/shutdown <br>
  <br>
  Replacing a capacitor on the graphics with a higher value allows the power line to either match the no longer consistent/expected voltage... <br>
  regardless what the hardware or software is doing.<br>
<br>
  A similar issue happens with the Playstation 3 COK-001 Motherboards... the 1001(?) error but this is still a tantalum capacitor so w/e.<br>
<br>
<br>
This thing is extremely dirty but here are a few pictures. <br>

That being said this has worked for the last 4-5 years after I found it on Craigslist.... <br>
