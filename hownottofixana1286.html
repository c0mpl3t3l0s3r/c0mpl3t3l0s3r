This page contains information regarding Kernel Panic errors in A1286 Macbook Pro laptops from 2008-12.

Motherboard Revision: EMC No.:2353 

**The pcb isn't really marked so it is unclear exactly what capacitor it is. 
  If I can find a schematic I will update this.**

If the computer switch's between the igpu to the onboard graphics chip the computer will freeze/shutdown 
  
  Replacing a capacitor on the graphics with a higher value allows the power line to either match the no longer consistent/expected voltage... 
  regardless what the hardware or software is doing.

  A similar issue happens with the Playstation 3 COK-001 Motherboards... the 1001(?) error but this is still a tantalum capacitor so w/e.

  That being said this has worked for the last 4-5 years after I found it on Craigslist.... now I need to find a screen so I figured I'd post this.

This thing is extremely dirty but here are a few pictures.
