This page contains information regarding Kernel Panic errors in A1286 Macbook Pro laptops from 2008-12.<br>
<br>
Motherboard Revision: EMC No.:2353 i5<br>
<br>
**The pcb isn't really marked so it is unclear exactly what capacitor it is. <br>
  If I can find a schematic I will update this.**<br>
<br>
If the computer switch's between the igpu to the onboard graphics chip the computer will freeze/shutdown <br>
  <br>
  Replacing a capacitor on the graphics with a higher value [equal value] allows the power line to either match the no longer consistent/expected voltage... <br>
  regardless what the hardware or software is doing. You have to scratch the pcb etching to make a new ground point. <br>
<br>
  Capacitor value is uknown but 337 2R5k 846 are the markings guessing its something like 330uf @ 25ohm I cannot find where I had gotten them from.<br>
  A similar issue happens with the Playstation 3 COK-001 Motherboards... the 1001(?) error but this is still a tantalum capacitor so w/e.<br>
<br>
<br>
This thing is extremely dirty but here are a few pictures. <br>
