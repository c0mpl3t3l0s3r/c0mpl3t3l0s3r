First, put all the multiple iso files into a folder. You need to open the command prompt at that folder, you can do that by opening that folder first, then follow 0:47 to 0:54 of this video: https://youtube.com/watch?v=bgSSJQolR0E

Now type in copy /b xxxxxx.part0.iso+xxxxxx.part1.iso+xxxxxx.part2.iso fulliso.iso

Replace xxxxxx.part0.iso with the name of the first part of your iso (if you have a part 0, it comes before part 1), xxxxxx.part1.iso with the name of the second part of your iso, so on. If you have a part 3, you have to type +xxxxxx.part3.iso after +xxxxxx.part2.iso and replace xxxxxx.part3.iso with the name of the third part of your iso, repeat until you entered in all the names of your iso parts.

After you hit the enter button, you should get fulliso.iso in the folder which is your full iso.
