How To Reformat iPod as Windows format with SD/CF Card Mod (Fat32) 
------------------------------------------------------------------

I was recieving a 1413 error in itunes 12 and reformatting the sd card (fat32/exfat)
wasn't allowing me to restore in windows but was able restore in itunes 12.9.5.5 running in mojave to hfs format.

If you can format your ipod with a sd/cf adapter in mac os but not in windows this is what i found to 
restore/format back to Fat32 Windows device format.

Install an older version of iTunes 7.0.2.16 or similiar on Windows 7 or earlier

(may work on 8/10/11 but recieved install errors i made a windows 7 vm and seemed to work good)

The lastest 12.12+ itunes versions don't seem to have the same support for older iPods in windows anyway but needed to download
the ipod software .ipsw file.

Connect ipod in latest itunes and click restore it should give a few prompts then download the update but will fail to restore.

The update files usually download to:

C:\Users\UserName\AppData\Roaming\Apple Computer\iTunes\iPod Software Updates -- iPod_13.1.3.ipsw 

Once the older version of itunes is installed connect the ipod navigate to restore
 hold and shift click on restore 
 -- navigate to the ipod firmware .ipsw file and it should restore to a windows fat32 formatted device.
