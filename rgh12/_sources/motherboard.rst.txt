Motherboard Identification
===========================

Next find which revision & motherboard the console has.

The diagram above should help identify your motherboard from the power rating
and socket type.

.. note::
   If the motherboard is a Corona there are four revisions.
   V1 doesn't require a post-fix adapter but V2-V4 needs one aswell as the resistor points bridged
   look `Here <_images/coronaguide.jpg>`_
   to confirm the motherboard revision. 
   
   Certain Corona motherboards come with a 4gb eMMC nand which 
   requires either an sd card tool or an XFlasher to read and write the nand. `Here <https://weekendmodder.com/RGH-Corona4gb.html>`_
   is a guide on reading & writing 4gb nands by WeekendModder.
