Modified Nand
=======================

After booting into XeLL and retrieving the CPU key,
its time to make a modified Nand image with J-Runners XeBuild function.
Creating a modified Nand is also reffered to as a FreeBoot image.

XeBuild Image

*It may be there automatically if J-Runner hasn't been closed*

Once xeBuild finishes its time to write the final image to the console

5. Click "Write Nand"


After J-Runner is done writing unplug the power and the programmer from the motherboard.

Wait a minute or so then turn the console on and if all went well the console will boot up to the stock dashboard.

After the initial startup power down the console and
press the eject button it should now load into Xell.
