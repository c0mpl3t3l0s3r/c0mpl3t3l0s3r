Connect power to the motherboard, plug in fans and ring of light board.

Power on the console and it should start up into XeLL. If the console takes longer the +/- 60 seconds or so
try flashing a different timing file. For Falcon and Jasper Consoles with an Ace V3 try flashing the dynamic
tuning file.

After a few seconds Xell will initialize the system and output the fusesets and CPU/DVD keys.

Write down the CPU key, it is needed to create a modified image with XeBuild in the next step.

As XeLL starts a  http server is started, connecting the console via ethernet and enter the local IP address
into a web browser, the CPU/DVD keys along with options to download raw flash, key vaults and fuse sets.
