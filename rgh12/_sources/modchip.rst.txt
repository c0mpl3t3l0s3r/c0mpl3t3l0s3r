Modchips
======================

The modchip or glitch chip is a key piece to making the console boot console into a modified state.

Here is a few Xilinx based modchips that work great with this method.

X360 Ace V3

Great chip also supports dynamic tuning files.

*Recommended for Slim consoles with the S-RGH method*

CoolRunner RevC	
**********************

Originally made by Team Xecuter but clones are still available.

Matrix Glitcher

Another great modchip consistent boot times.

All of these chips achieve the same results. The Coolrunner and Matrix chips require soldering
a smaller clock point on the motherboard.
