Modchip Installation
=============================

Wiring up the motherboard is the most difficult part of this whole process.
Some points are very small so take your time clean your points and use flux.


A good location for the modchip is on the a/v shield shown 
below or under the disc drive on slim consoles.

Once the modchip is wired in, its time to boot into XeLL to get 
the consoles CPU key.
