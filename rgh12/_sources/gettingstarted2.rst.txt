Getting Started
================
   
Here is a brief walkthrough into installing modchips inside the Xbox 360 using Reset Glitch Hack 1.2 method created by 15432.
The Reset Glitch Hack allows the Xbox to run unsigned code, emulators and all sorts of homebrew. 
Some hardware and software as well as the console itself are required.
