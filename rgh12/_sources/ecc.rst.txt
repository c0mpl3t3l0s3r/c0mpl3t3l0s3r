ECC Images
======================

Creating and writing an ECC image to your console overwrites the
first 50 blocks of the nand allowing the console to boot Xell.

Xell is a Linux based bootloader allowing access to the consoles
cpu/dvd keys, fuse sets and other critical system information. The cpu key
is needed to build the final modified nand image.

Make sure "Dash Version" is set to 17559 and your motherboard revision is correct.

A. Select Glitch2 in the XeBuild section
B. Click "Create ECC"
C. Click "Write ECC"


.. note::
	When clicking the "Create ECC" button it may ask to load a nand dump.
	Navigate to the nandump1.bin from the nand read. It may be there if 
	J-Runner hasn't been closed.
	
After the ECC is finished writing disconnect the programmer from the r/w wires on the motherboard
along with the power cables.
