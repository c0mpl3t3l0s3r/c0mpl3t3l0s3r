   contain the root `toctree` directive.


Modchip Timing
=============================

The modchips use a Xilinx based chip, flashing
specific .XSVF and .SVF timing files to boot the console.

To program the modchip either solder or use a 
pin header to connect the xsvf cable to the programmer.


The middle 6 wire J-TAG-XSVF cable is needed to connect the modchip to the programmer.

Here is a picture of the program points for the X360 Ace V2.

This is the CoolRunner chip which has a presoldered pin header

Timing the Modchip
*******************

In J-Runner select the advanced menu and click on "Custom Nand/Timing File Functions"

.. image:: _images/customfunc.gif

A. Select XSVF/SVF on command selection
B. Click "..." navigate to your RGH 1.2 timing files from links above
C. Click "Run" to write the file


From here finding the timing file for each console is different.
Below are a few files to start with.

Alternatively you can use the built-in Timing file programmer part of JRunner.
This section has a collection of reliable timings for each motherboad.

.. note::
	Every console is different, you may have to flash a few different timing
	files to see what achieves a reliable boot cycle. For Falcon and Jasper consoles
	with an AceV3 use the dynamic tuning file if you can't get the console to boot.
