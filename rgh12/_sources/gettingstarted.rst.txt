Getting Started
================
   
Since the launch of the Xbox 360 there have been many ways to run unsigned code. Here is a brief history of different modifcations to the 360.

	A few of the first exploits were found using the consoles disc drive. Flashing the drive with a custom firmware made reading
	backup games possible. The King Kong or "KK" exploit uses a modified shader to patch King Kong allowing the 360 to boot into Linux.
	Although it is only possible on very early dashboard versions 4532 and 4548.

	The J-TAG or "SMC" hack was released in 2007. By soldering a couple diodes, a jumper wire and writing a modified
	SMC the console is able to boot into a modified state. In 2009 the J-Tag exploit was patched in dashboard version 7371. 
	Finding consoles on 7371 or below is rare. 
	
	Since then the Reset Glitch Hack or "RGH" was found by GliGli and devs around 2011.
	The Reset Hack Glitch hack works by sending a small pulse from a modchip to the reset signal of the CPU to "glitch" the console.
	This method requires timing a modchip, running a few wires and writing a custom nand image to the console. RGH is supported on many dashboards
	and works on most consoles.
	
	Here is a `post <https://discourse.world/h/2020/05/12/Protecting-and-Hacking-the-Xbox-360(Part-3)>`_ by 15432 that goes in 
	depth on how the Reset Glitch Hack works.	  
	
There have been many revisions to the J-Tag and Reset Glitch Hack. This doc references 
the Reset Glitch Hack 1.2 and S-RGH methods  created by 15432. 

.. warning::
   Attempting these modification can permanently damage the console! Proceed with caution!
   Connecting to Xbox Live will most likely ban the console. 
   Please don't pirate games, support the developers and local game shops.
