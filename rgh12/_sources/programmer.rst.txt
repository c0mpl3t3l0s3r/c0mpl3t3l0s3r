Programmer/Nand Flasher
==============================

A programmer is a key piece to read & write to the consoles nand. Most programmers also have the capability to 
flash timing files to a modchip. 

XFlasher360
**********************
.. image:: _images/xflasher.jpg
A new nand flasher developed by Element18592 and devs.
Faster read & writes than the JRP and NandX. Also
supports 4gb eMMC Corona nands.

JR-Programmer	
**********************
.. image:: _images/jrprogsm.png
The JR-Programmer was originally made by Team Xecuter but clones are still available.

Nand-X
**********************
.. image:: _images/nandx.jpg
Another Team Xecuter device that is a bit faster than the JR-Programmer.

Matrix SPI Programmer
**********************
.. image:: _images/matrixprog.jpg
Stable read & writes and can be modified to program modchips.

LPT Cable
**********************
.. image:: _images/parallel.jpg
Alternatively using a lpt connector and parrallel port on an older PC its possible to create a diy nand reading cable.
`Here <https://quade.co/2017/trinity-rgh/>`_ is a guide by William Quade on how to put one together.
This method is slower compared to using one of the programmer.

	*Xflasher are located in the J-Runner menu.*
